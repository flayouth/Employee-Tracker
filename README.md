<h1>Employee-Tracker</h1>

<p>For Module 12's Challenge, I developed a practical solution for managing employees within a company using node.js, inquirer, console.table, and MySQL2. The application includes the following features:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Viewing all Employees, Roles, or Departments</li>
    <li>Searching for Employees by Manager</li>
    <li>Updating Employees Roles or Manager</li>
    <li>Adding Employee, Role, or Department</li>
    <li>Removing Employee, Role, or Department</li>
    <li>Viewing Department's total utilized budget</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Prior to running the application, ensure that node.js is installed on your device.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The application will be invoked by running the following command with the application:</p>
<pre><code>npm run start</code></pre>
